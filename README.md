# open-apis
Microservice apis for HAX webcomponents repo that are shared infrastructure calls

This repo hosts shared infrastructure as well as the storybook to communicate about different elements in our repo.

This was previously hosted as part of https://github.com/haxtheweb/webcomponents and needed to be split off due to growth of both repos.

`/api/` - vercel endpoints / shared API infrastructure for HAXTheWeb advanced capabilities like importing, parsing, analysis, migration

`/storybook/` -  pre-built storybook generated by https://github.com/haxtheweb/webcomponents
